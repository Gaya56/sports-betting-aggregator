## Milestone Achievement ðŸŽ‰

### What We Accomplished

**Repository Setup**
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/Gaya56/sports-betting-aggregator
- Full project structure with modular design
- Integrated AgentQL + OpenAI for intelligent scraping
- Set up uv package manager environment

**Technical Implementation**
- Built 5 scrapers (Covers, WagerTalk, Pickswise, ATS.io, VegasInsider)
- Abstract base class for consistent architecture
- AI-powered error handling and query fixing
- Rate limiting and data validation
- Standardized pick data model

**Current Status**
- All scrapers run without crashes
- AgentQL queries need refinement for each site
- **Key Discovery**: Most sites require login for full pick details

### Remaining Work

**Immediate**
1. Create accounts on betting sites
2. Update scrapers with login logic
3. Refine AgentQL queries using Chrome extension
4. Implement click-through for detailed picks

**Pipeline Integration**
1. Connect BigQuery for data storage
2. Build aggregation logic across sources
3. Create confidence scoring algorithm
4. Generate daily pick + parlay recommendations

**ML & Automation**
1. Set up Vertex AI for predictions
2. Implement continuous monitoring
3. Build learning loop from results
4. Deploy scheduled automation

**Current Blocker**: Login requirements - once accounts are created, we can properly debug and extract actual betting picks instead of just preview data.
